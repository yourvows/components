# Composables

This page serves as a comprehensive guide to utilizing Vue.js composables within the UIC framework.

## Introduction

Composables in Vue.js are a powerful feature that allows developers to encapsulate logic into reusable functions, providing a clean and efficient way to manage stateful behavior and data manipulation. In the context of UIC, Vue.js composables are leveraged to enhance the modularity and reusability of code, enabling developers to efficiently build complex user interfaces while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase.

## List of Composables

### useCookie

The `useCookie` composable facilitates easy management of browser cookies within Vue.js applications. With simple and intuitive methods, developers can read, write, and delete cookies, enabling seamless integration of cookie-based functionality such as user authentication, preferences management, and session tracking.

### useForm

The `useForm` composable provides a robust solution for handling form state and validation logic in Vue.js applications. By abstracting common form-related tasks into reusable functions, developers can streamline the process of creating dynamic and interactive forms, while ensuring data integrity and user experience consistency.
